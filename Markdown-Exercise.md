## Emphasis
Different styles of text are used to create emphasis in writing such as _italics_ and **bold**.
## Lists
Lists are used to organize ideas, such as my favorite drinks:
-Coffee
-Pomagranate Juice
-Mang Smootie
Or you can use and ordered list to create a ranking, such as the top three dirvers on the F1 grid in recent years:
1. Max Verstappen
2. Charles Lecerc
3. Lewis Hamilton
## Links
Links can be used to provide additional information if needed. For example, the official [F1 2026 car regulations](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/explained-2026-aerodynamic-regulations-fia-twitter-mode-z-mode-.26c1CtOzCmN3GfLMywrgb2), this way others can know where information came from and can take a look for themselves if they want to.

## Images 

Images can be used to provide additional context or just a simple visual to the page, here's my cat Hoshi for example:
![picture of Hoshi](https://github.com/tmanha05/Data-110-Fall-2025/blob/main/IMG_7100.jpg?raw=true)
## Block Quotes
This feature is used to callout important quotes that you may want to add, like:
>“Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” _Edgar Allen Poe_
## Inline Code & Code Blocks
Inline Codes and Code Blocks are used to show the code used to create certain elements or sections of a website
for example `print("this is a line of code!")`
or something more complext like this c++ code:
```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
    int arrSize = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Calculate the size of the array

    cout << "Original array: ";
    for(int i = 0; i < arrSize; ++i) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Modify the even numbers
    for(int i = 0; i < arrSize; ++i) {
        if(arr[i] % 2 == 0) { // Check if the number is even
            arr[i] += 10; // Modify the even number (adding 10 in this case)
        }
    }

    cout << "Modified array: ";
    for(int i = 0; i < arrSize; ++i) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;

```
##Tables
Tables are also used to organize ideas, but this time they are used for categorization as well for example

| Activity      | # of Times Done in a Week |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Walking  | 23  |
| Work  | 8  |
| Drawing  | 15  |
| Archery  | 3  |

## Tasks Lists
Task lists are used to orgaize and check off certain tasks as you go for example:
- [ ] laundry
- [x] feed hoshi
- [ ] schedule appointment

##Footnotes
Footnotes are used to provde extra context if needed like so[^1]
[^1]:The most fundamental aspect of a footnote is perhaps that it is written and read in a voice different from the main text.
